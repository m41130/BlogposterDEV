# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]
- Fixed "SELECT_MODULE_BY_NAME" placeholder reading undefined variable `data`.
  Both Postgres and Mongo drivers now extract `moduleName` from `params`.
- Added ObjectId validation in Mongo placeholders to prevent crashes from invalid IDs.
- Fixed MongoDB page creation to store lane, language and title so seeded pages
  and widgets appear correctly.
- Fixed MongoDB logins failing when userId strings were not converted to ObjectId.
- Added warnings when admin_jwt cookies are cleared due to invalid tokens.
- Removed `config/environment.js`; `isProduction` now comes from `config/runtime.js`.
- Documented HTTPS requirement for login cookies in `docs/security.md`.
- Added warning when secure login cookies are set over HTTP.
- Added `APP_ENV` variable to toggle production mode via `.env` and updated
  `config/runtime.js` plus documentation to use it.
- Masked password fields in updateUserProfile and user creation logs to prevent
  leaking credentials during debugging.
- Fixed MongoDB logins failing after role assignments. `localDbUpdate` now
  interprets `{__raw_expr}` increment expressions and new users start with
  `token_version` set to `0`.
- Fixed token_version updates on MongoDB. Role assignments now use `_id` when
  incrementing the version so user tokens invalidate correctly.
- Masked passwords in userManagement logs to avoid credential leaks.

- Fixed pagesManager start page setup on MongoDB. `SET_AS_START` no longer uses
  an undefined `client` object, preventing module meltdown and login failures.
- Fixed role lookup when logging in on MongoDB setups. Role IDs are now compared as strings to avoid ObjectId mismatches.
- Fixed user login failing on MongoDB setups. `getUserDetailsById` now queries `_id` instead of `id`, so finalize login works properly.
- Removed deprecated `useUnifiedTopology` option from MongoDB connections to avoid warnings.
- Fixed false "Invalid parameters" errors when MongoDB operations passed an
  object instead of an array to `performDbOperation`. The listener now accepts
  both formats and no longer deactivates modules like `widgetManager` during
  startup.
- Fixed registration on MongoDB setups. `createUser` now recognizes
  `insertOne` results and reconstructs the created user object while
  preserving compatibility with PostgreSQL and SQLite responses.
- Fixed MongoDB database initialization failing when a module user already exists.
  Settings manager now loads correctly and registers event listeners.
- Fixed MongoDB integration. Local CRUD events now translate to Mongo operations
  instead of raw SQL, enabling proper widget management and other features when
  `CONTENT_DB_TYPE` is set to `mongodb`.
- Resolved open handle warning in Jest by stubbing `dbSelect` in the
  `setAsStart` test.
- Updated placeholder parity check to invoke Jest so the script works again.
- Switched test runner to Jest and converted all integration tests.
- Adjusted release workflow to read the changelog from the repository root.
- Fixed default share link domain; now uses `APP_BASE_URL` or `https://example.com`.
- Ensured `library/public` directory is created during startup so media uploads don't fail.
- Fixed image widget state persistence by passing `widgetId` to widgets.
- Fixed role assignment on MongoDB. `dbSelect` now normalizes `_id` to `id`,
  ensuring roles attach correctly during user creation.
- Added test verifying Mongo user collections match PostgreSQL tables.
- Extended parity test to cover all Mongo collections across modules.

## [0.4.1] – 2025-06-05
- Fixed missing CSRF token on admin subpages causing 403 errors when uploading media.
- Added token validation on all admin routes and the meltdown API to prevent
  unauthorized access after a database reset.
- Centralized DB placeholder logic for better maintainability.
- Fixed widget loading on SQLite by using `?` placeholders for generic CRUD helpers.
- Fixed pagesManager meta data on SQLite. Objects are now stored as JSON
  and parsed when reading back.
- Fixed plainSpace layout loading on SQLite. Layout JSON is now parsed when
  fetching to match Postgres behavior.
- Added release workflow that publishes zipped build assets and release notes after running security audits, tests and CodeQL analysis.
- Removed the `cms.sqlite` database from version control and now ignore
  `BlogposterCMS/data` to prevent accidental leaks of local data.
- Prevent logging of full public tokens during pagesManager initialization.
- Verified all SQLite placeholders across modules to ensure inserted IDs use the new return value.
- SQLite engine now returns `{ lastID, changes }` for write operations,
  preventing `Cannot destructure property 'lastID'` errors during page creation.
- Resolved SQLite errors on startup by avoiding `ALTER TABLE ... IF NOT EXISTS`
  and by removing Postgres schema notation when using SQLite.
- Fixed database engine selection. The `.env` variable `CONTENT_DB_TYPE`
  now overrides the legacy `DB_TYPE` to match the documentation.
- The internal database manager no longer requires PostgreSQL when
  `CONTENT_DB_TYPE` is set to `mongodb` or `sqlite`.
- Fixed SQLite initialization race for settingsManager tables and added
  compatibility with older SQLite versions.

### Fixed
- Resolved SyntaxError in SQLite placeholder handler causing server startup failure.

## [0.4.0] – 2025-06-04
- CI now verifies placeholder parity for Postgres, MongoDB and SQLite on every
  push.
- Replaced SQLite placeholder handler with full Postgres parity and added
  automated parity test.
- Added Mongo placeholder parity test and CLI command to validate database placeholders.
- Documentation on why custom post types aren't necessary (see `docs/custom_post_types.md`).
- Added UI screenshots to the README and usage guide for easier onboarding.
- Expanded dashboard screenshot series to illustrate widget arrangement.
- Experimental SQLite support added alongside Postgres and MongoDB.
- Added SQLite placeholder handler to support built-in operations.


## [0.3.1] – 2025-06-03

### 🛡️ Security

- **🔥 Big Fat Security Patch™ Edition:**
  Closed **29 security issues** in one glorious cleanup session.
  No, we won’t list every file. Just know: it was ugly, it’s clean now.

- Highlights:
  - Removed **hard-coded credentials** (yes, seriously… 😬)
  - Fixed multiple **XSS vectors** (reflected *and* client-side)
  - Blocked **prototype pollution** (because `__proto__` is nobody’s friend)
  - Added **rate limiting** and **CSRF protection** (finally acting like adults)
  - Sanitized **format strings**, **random sources**, **URL redirects**, and more
  - Killed dangerous **regexes** before they killed your server
  
> If you downloaded BlogposterCMS before this patch, consider it a collectible item.  
> Like a vintage car – dangerous but historically significant.
