### 🛡️ Security

- **🔥 Big Fat Security Patch™ Edition:**
  Closed **29 security issues** in one glorious cleanup session.
  No, we won’t list every file. Just know: it was ugly, it’s clean now.

- Highlights:
  - Removed **hard-coded credentials** (yes, seriously… 😬)
  - Fixed multiple **XSS vectors** (reflected *and* client-side)
  - Blocked **prototype pollution** (because `__proto__` is nobody’s friend)
  - Added **rate limiting** and **CSRF protection** (finally acting like adults)
  - Sanitized **format strings**, **random sources**, **URL redirects**, and more
  - Killed dangerous **regexes** before they killed your server
  
> If you downloaded BlogposterCMS before this patch, consider it a collectible item.  
> Like a vintage car – dangerous but historically significant.
