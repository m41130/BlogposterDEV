## [Unreleased]
- Builder widgets unlock when clicking outside and show a lock icon while active.
- Widgets now lock on click in the builder so they can be edited globally.
- Fixed theme styles not applying in the builder by importing the active theme stylesheet inside widget shadow roots.
- Resolved blank widgets when opening the code editor by loading widget scripts using absolute URLs.
- Fixed builder widgets showing blank when CSS was injected before widget content.
- Text block widget now loads the Quill library and styles on demand so editing
  works in sandboxed widgets.
- Builder widget CSS now loads gridstack and admin styles before the active theme
  to avoid layout conflicts.
- Active theme CSS is now injected into public pages and builder grid only.
- Builder widgets preview using theme styles without affecting the admin UI.
- Implemented "Hello World" default theme with Inter typography, electric-purple accent and micro-interactions.
- Fixed text block widget not showing the Lorem Ipsum placeholder when first
  added and ensured the Quill editor initializes on click.
- Text block widget now displays a Lorem Ipsum placeholder and activates the
  Quill editor on click. Edits are sanitized before being stored.
- Improved text block widget sanitization and only load the Quill editor when
  editing to reduce attack surface.
- Fixed widget code editor so unsaved JS doesn't overwrite HTML when closing the
  builder edit overlay.
- Removed placeholder text from all public widgets to preserve user edits.
- Moved text block widget styles to SCSS for easier maintenance.
- Text block widget now uses a Quill editor with dynamic sizing and HTML
  sanitation.
- Removed Quill from the builder widget HTML editor; now a simple textarea is used.
- Options menu in the builder now appears outside widgets for better visibility.
- Builder widgets now have a three-dot menu with edit and duplicate actions, and the remove button moved to the left.
- Updated README: linked to bp-cli, collapsed screenshots in a details section, added GridStack reference and license header note.
- Improved README structure with an alpha badge, quick install snippet and more descriptive screenshot alt text.
- Added a CONTRIBUTING guide and linked it from the README.
- Styled modules settings widget to match page manager.
- Hardened dummyModule logging and made callbacks optional.
- Fixed dummyModule initialization by using payload-based `performDbOperation` calls.
- Documented dummyModule usage and added developer-friendly comments.
- Translated dummyModule comments to English and expanded template guide.

## [0.4.2] – 2025-06-07
- Fixed admin wildcard route to parse hex page IDs for MongoDB.
- Sanitized meltdown event logs to prevent format string injection.
- Mongo page queries now include an `id` field so admin edit links work.
- Marked `touchstart` handlers as passive in builder and page renderers to avoid scroll-blocking warnings.
- Fixed builder layout saves on MongoDB by preserving string page IDs.
- Kept builder pageId query params as strings so Mongo ObjectIds save correctly without affecting Postgres.
- Logged failed meltdown events to server console for easier debugging when layout saves fail.
- Fixed SQLite "SELECT_MODULE_BY_NAME" to accept array or object params like other drivers.
- Fixed regression test by stubbing `db.run` in the SQLite placeholder test.
- Added example `MONGODB_URI` with `replicaSet` parameter in env.sample and
  updated docs to clarify replica set usage.
- Documented MongoDB replica set requirement for transaction-based modules to prevent startup failures.
- Timestamps now stored in UTC using `new Date().toISOString()` for all `created_at` and `updated_at` fields.
- Ensured Mongo unique indexes are created foreground with retry logic for
  user, page and widget collections to avoid race-condition duplicates.
- Fixed Mongo `SET_AS_START` to run within a transaction using
  `session.withTransaction()` so the previous start page flag can't remain
  active when the update partially fails.
- Fixed Mongo `CREATE_SHARE_LINK` to return the inserted document for driver v4 compatibility.
- Unified ID handling across Server-, Media- and ShareManager for Mongo. Inserts now store an `id` string matching the ObjectId and all queries use that field.
- Fixed Mongo pages missing an `id` field which broke layout loading in `getLayoutForViewport`.
- Mongo `GET_PAGES_BY_LANE` now returns the same structure as Postgres with `trans_*` fields for each translation.
- Unified `GET_PAGE_BY_SLUG` across all databases to return a single page object instead of an array.
- Normalized Mongo `CHECK_MODULE_REGISTRY_COLUMNS` to return `{ column_name }` rows like other drivers.
- Removed legacy Mongo placeholders `SET_AS_SUBPAGE`, `ASSIGN_PAGE_TO_POSTTYPE` and `INIT_WIDGETS_TABLE` to match Postgres parity.
- Fixed "SELECT_MODULE_BY_NAME" placeholder reading undefined variable `data`.
  Both Postgres and Mongo drivers now extract `moduleName` from `params`.
- Added ObjectId validation in Mongo placeholders to prevent crashes from invalid IDs.
- Fixed MongoDB page creation to store lane, language and title so seeded pages
  and widgets appear correctly.
- Fixed MongoDB logins failing when userId strings were not converted to ObjectId.
- Added warnings when admin_jwt cookies are cleared due to invalid tokens.
- Removed `config/environment.js`; `isProduction` now comes from `config/runtime.js`.
- Documented HTTPS requirement for login cookies in `docs/security.md`.
- Added warning when secure login cookies are set over HTTP.
- Added `APP_ENV` variable to toggle production mode via `.env` and updated
  `config/runtime.js` plus documentation to use it.
- Masked password fields in updateUserProfile and user creation logs to prevent
  leaking credentials during debugging.
- Fixed MongoDB logins failing after role assignments. `localDbUpdate` now
  interprets `{__raw_expr}` increment expressions and new users start with
  `token_version` set to `0`.
- Fixed token_version updates on MongoDB. Role assignments now use `_id` when
  incrementing the version so user tokens invalidate correctly.
- Masked passwords in userManagement logs to avoid credential leaks.

- Fixed pagesManager start page setup on MongoDB. `SET_AS_START` no longer uses
  an undefined `client` object, preventing module meltdown and login failures.
- Fixed role lookup when logging in on MongoDB setups. Role IDs are now compared as strings to avoid ObjectId mismatches.
- Fixed user login failing on MongoDB setups. `getUserDetailsById` now queries `_id` instead of `id`, so finalize login works properly.
- Removed deprecated `useUnifiedTopology` option from MongoDB connections to avoid warnings.
- Fixed false "Invalid parameters" errors when MongoDB operations passed an
  object instead of an array to `performDbOperation`. The listener now accepts
  both formats and no longer deactivates modules like `widgetManager` during
  startup.
- Fixed registration on MongoDB setups. `createUser` now recognizes
  `insertOne` results and reconstructs the created user object while
  preserving compatibility with PostgreSQL and SQLite responses.
- Fixed MongoDB database initialization failing when a module user already exists.
  Settings manager now loads correctly and registers event listeners.
- Fixed MongoDB integration. Local CRUD events now translate to Mongo operations
  instead of raw SQL, enabling proper widget management and other features when
  `CONTENT_DB_TYPE` is set to `mongodb`.
- Resolved open handle warning in Jest by stubbing `dbSelect` in the
  `setAsStart` test.
- Updated placeholder parity check to invoke Jest so the script works again.
- Switched test runner to Jest and converted all integration tests.
- Adjusted release workflow to read the changelog from the repository root.
- Fixed default share link domain; now uses `APP_BASE_URL` or `https://example.com`.
- Ensured `library/public` directory is created during startup so media uploads don't fail.
- Fixed image widget state persistence by passing `widgetId` to widgets.
- Fixed role assignment on MongoDB. `dbSelect` now normalizes `_id` to `id`,
  ensuring roles attach correctly during user creation.
- Added test verifying Mongo user collections match PostgreSQL tables.
- Extended parity test to cover all Mongo collections across modules.

## [0.4.1] – 2025-06-05
- Fixed missing CSRF token on admin subpages causing 403 errors when uploading media.
- Added token validation on all admin routes and the meltdown API to prevent
  unauthorized access after a database reset.
- Centralized DB placeholder logic for better maintainability.
- Fixed widget loading on SQLite by using `?` placeholders for generic CRUD helpers.
- Fixed pagesManager meta data on SQLite. Objects are now stored as JSON
  and parsed when reading back.
- Fixed plainSpace layout loading on SQLite. Layout JSON is now parsed when
  fetching to match Postgres behavior.
- Added release workflow that publishes zipped build assets and release notes after running security audits, tests and CodeQL analysis.
- Removed the `cms.sqlite` database from version control and now ignore
  `BlogposterCMS/data` to prevent accidental leaks of local data.
- Prevent logging of full public tokens during pagesManager initialization.
- Verified all SQLite placeholders across modules to ensure inserted IDs use the new return value.
- SQLite engine now returns `{ lastID, changes }` for write operations,
  preventing `Cannot destructure property 'lastID'` errors during page creation.
- Resolved SQLite errors on startup by avoiding `ALTER TABLE ... IF NOT EXISTS`
  and by removing Postgres schema notation when using SQLite.
- Fixed database engine selection. The `.env` variable `CONTENT_DB_TYPE`
  now overrides the legacy `DB_TYPE` to match the documentation.
- The internal database manager no longer requires PostgreSQL when
  `CONTENT_DB_TYPE` is set to `mongodb` or `sqlite`.
- Fixed SQLite initialization race for settingsManager tables and added
  compatibility with older SQLite versions.

### Fixed
- Resolved SyntaxError in SQLite placeholder handler causing server startup failure.

## [0.4.0] – 2025-06-04
- CI now verifies placeholder parity for Postgres, MongoDB and SQLite on every
  push.
- Replaced SQLite placeholder handler with full Postgres parity and added
  automated parity test.
- Added Mongo placeholder parity test and CLI command to validate database placeholders.
- Documentation on why custom post types aren't necessary (see `docs/custom_post_types.md`).
- Added UI screenshots to the README and usage guide for easier onboarding.
- Expanded dashboard screenshot series to illustrate widget arrangement.
- Experimental SQLite support added alongside Postgres and MongoDB.
- Added SQLite placeholder handler to support built-in operations.

- Highlights:
  - Removed **hard-coded credentials** (yes, seriously… 😬)
  - Fixed multiple **XSS vectors** (reflected *and* client-side)
  - Blocked **prototype pollution** (because `__proto__` is nobody’s friend)
  - Added **rate limiting** and **CSRF protection** (finally acting like adults)
  - Sanitized **format strings**, **random sources**, **URL redirects**, and more
  - Killed dangerous **regexes** before they killed your server
  
> If you downloaded BlogposterCMS before this patch, consider it a collectible item.  
> Like a vintage car – dangerous but historically significant.
